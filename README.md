## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into

- **First Time with Three.js & React Integration**  
  This was our first time exploring Three.js. We started by watching a few YouTube tutorials and then moved on to the official documentation. While we were able to grasp basic concepts, integrating Three.js into a React environment using `@react-three/fiber` turned out to be much more complex than expected. Managing components, reactivity, and scene updates required a lot of trial and error.

- **Finding the Right 3D Character & Classroom Model**  
  Choosing suitable 3D assets was another challenge. We initially used Mixamo for character animations and classroom models, but finding a balance between quality and compatibility took time and effort.

- **Using Blender for the First Time**  
  Blender was completely new to us. Importing, editing, and exporting models correctly for web use proved to be a steep learning curve. Simple tasks like adjusting poses or fixing animations became time-consuming.

- **Implementing WebSocket Rooms**  
  While we were already familiar with the basic concepts of WebSockets, using them in combination with a 3D environment was a first. Creating synchronized virtual rooms that multiple users could join and interact in required careful handling of socket events and scene updates.

- **MCQ Generation using Anthropic AI**  
  In the second phase of the project, we attempted to generate MCQs using Anthropic’s AI API. Integrating the API, formatting questions correctly, and handling edge cases was more difficult than anticipated.

- **Exporting Results to PDF**  
  Downloading user results as a PDF seemed like a minor feature at first, but involved a fair bit of complexity—especially in terms of layout design, formatting, and consistent rendering across browsers.

> There were several moments where we felt stuck and even considered giving up. But after pushing through all the hurdles, we’re proud to present the final product you see today.
